# Release Notes

## Release 0.3.3 (23th March 2023)
* Added additional `arguments` option for queues and exchanges to allow 
  setting further arguments.

## Release 0.3.2 (17th March 2023)
* Added additional configuration options for queues and exchanges. This allows
  creating/working with durable or non-durable, internal or non-internal,
  exclusive or non-exclusive queues and exchanges. This introduces a number of
  breaking changes. If these additional configuration options are not needed,
  there should simply be no need to update in which case there are no changes.
  If these options are needed, configurations will have to be updated anyway to
  configure them.
* **BREAKING CHANGES**
  * Requires MATLAB R2019b or newer instead of R2017b or newer.
  * `queueName` configuration option/property has been removed. Instead there is
    now a `queue` object with `name` property, as well as a few new properties.
  * `exchange` configuration option/property is no longer just the exchange
    name. Instead it is now an object with `name` property as well as a few new
    properties.
* Updated documentation format.
* Published HTML documentation on GitHub pages.
